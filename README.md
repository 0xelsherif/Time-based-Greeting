# Time based Greeting

This simple web application displays a greeting message based on the current time of the day. It dynamically changes the greeting message (Good morning, Good afternoon, or Good evening) and appends a waving hand emoji to a designated element.

#### How it Works

The JavaScript code in `Time-based-Greeting.js` retrieves the current hour of the day, determines the appropriate greeting message, and updates the text content of the greeting element accordingly. It also appends a waving hand emoji to the tag element.
